## 2: Solve the white corners
With the white center on the down face,you should solve the white corner pieces.do the 3 formulas,you will resolve all white corners in the correct position.

S1.White piece on front

S2.White piece on right

S3.White piece on up

## 3: Solve the middle layers
With the 2 formulas,you can solve the middle layer,which means position the edge pieces in the correct position.

S1.Top edge move to front right

S2.Top edge move to back right

S3.Move middle edge to top

## 4: Solve the top yellow cross
Just one formula, you can turn the yellow edge pieces to the up face.   "FRUR'U'F'"

S1

S2,convert to S1

S3,convert to S2

## 5: Solve the all yellow top
Solve the up layer and get all the yellow,only need one formula to to the goal.  RUR'URU2R'

S1

S2,convert to S1

S3,convert to S1

S4,convert to S3

S5,convert to S2

S6,convert to S3


## 6: Position top yellow corner
Find a face which have two same color corners,set the face as front face,do the formula can complete all the yellow corners,if you don't find the face,do the formula one time.      "RB'RF2R'BRF2R2"

S1

S2,convert to S1

## 7: Position top yellow edge
Put the pieces that do not need to be swapped on back face, with this formula can counterclockwise rotate of the edge block, up to 3 times the formula can be restored Rubik's cube

S1

S2
